## ABOUT ME

Hello! I'm **Israel Aidoo** 🤓 — a data analyst, educator, and aspiring consultant with a drive to transform raw data into actionable insights. With hands-on experience in education, school systems, operations, and project coordination, I help institutions and businesses uncover opportunities, solve challenges, and make smarter decisions.

## WHAT I DO

*As the founder of EduSpark Tutors and an analyst at heart, I combine education and data expertise to train, advise, and create practical systems that work.*

**✅ Data Analytics Consulting**
I deliver customized analysis and visual reports that empower decision-makers to act based on data — not assumptions.

**✅ Training & Mentorship**
I design and lead training sessions on data tools (Excel, SQL, Python), and help junior analysts and students build real-world, job-ready skills.

**✅ School Systems & Automation**
I develop systems to streamline academic data — attendance, grading, reports — using MySQL, Excel, and Python-based dashboards.
